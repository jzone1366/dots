# Dotfiles
My dotfiles to start version controlling my setups for nvim and other programs.

## Installation
You need to clone this repository by running
`git clone git@github.com:jzone1366/dotfiles.git`

Once it's cloned then you can run `install.sh` to start symlinnking the configurations. THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE ACTION SO BACK UP EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU DO IT.

## Configuration

## Disclaimer
This is a work in progress. This is also set to defaults that I use and may not work correctly on your machine.
I currently use these settings on my Macbook at work and on my Linux Mint Machine at home.


## TODO:
* Add Linux script to install dependencies for Linux Mint.
* Add MacOSX script to install dependencies for Mac.

* Inspiration for the structure came from https://github.com/Phantas0s/.dotfiles
